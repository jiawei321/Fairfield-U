# BA 6505 FINAL PROJECT README

# **Analysis Based on Globlal Terrorism Database**
##FALL 2022

## MOTIVATION
Several months ago, we noticed a news that a terrorist organization caarried out an attack against Chinese teachers in Balchositan. Therefore, we want to know more about terrorist organizations and finally find a dataset called Global Terrorism Databse.

## DATASET SOURCE
The dataset is from the website Kaggle( https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd).
It contains all the recorded terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017. The dataset has 135 variables and more than 180000 rows.

## CHALLENGES
1. We googled a lot when trying to complete a part. There are always suprising errors, like type issue, forget sytanx of method or function. It cost us a lot of time but we finally figured it out. Just like Prof. Tao said to us, the best way to learn a language is to use it more frequently. We still need to work on more projects to practice our coding skills.

2. The geopgraphcial plot is another technical challenge for us. We googled a lot and tried various methods and finally got it work. The issue is it's hard to match the country name or region name between the raw data and the library requirment. We need to be perfect match to show the plot.

## LESSONS LEARNED
1. We learned effective approaches to deal with great-amouont-rows dataset effectively. Now we could use pandas and numpy to manapulate dataset as we want. And it's actually more effective than Excel.

2. We learned that cleaning data takes a lot of time and it really requires patience and carefulness. 

3. Logic is the most important thing in coding. Similarly, a story is the most important thing of presentation. A great stroy is based on great questions. We need to keep modifying our questions before acutal coding. As the questions are answered one by one, the story will gradually show itself.

4. Visualizations are critical to the stroytelling. However, We need to consider when do we need visualizatiions and in what form should we present. This will make the presentation clean and accurate.
